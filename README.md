Project Euler is a series of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems that will require more than just mathematical insights to solve. Although mathematics will help you arrive at elegant and efficient methods, the use of a computer and programming skills will be required to solve most problems.

The motivation for starting Project Euler, and its continuation, is to provide a platform for the inquiring mind to delve into unfamiliar areas and learn new concepts in a fun and recreational context.

# My approach
I program my solutions based on the descriptions of each problem on Hackerrank, which is an extension of the original problems. I included the original problems from ProjectEuler website in the description of each file.
